I want to study my japanese vocabulary by viewing random cards.
Each card contains either a word (doushi or a meishi) with the corresponding informations.

The flow is as follow:
- When I enter the page
  - I can see at the top some tabs
    - meishi tab
    - doushi tab
    - all tab (mix of meishi and doushi)
  - I can see the main content of the page which is the a card containing a word depending on the selected tab
    - The card contains:
      - Word
      - Kana
      - Definition
      - Example
  - At the bottom there are a few buttons
    - Next button, to go to the next word, depending on the selected tab
    - Previous button, to go to the previous word, depending on the selected tab
    - Random button, to go to random word, depending on the selected tab
